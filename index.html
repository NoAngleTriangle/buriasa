    <h1>Buriasa</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
Buriasa is the second largest Scratch army, below the Republic of Scratch. It is owned by Sable Keystone
 
Buriasa originated as a <a href="noangletriangle.github.io/classified-union">[Classified] Union</a> Republic created by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Operationrebirth/">@Operationrebirth</a> 
on October 19, 2024. Buriasa gained independence from the [Classified] Union on 11/1/2024, which was also the Day of the [Classified] Union's collapse. 
In June 2025, Buriasa grew an upwards of 100 followers a day before <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Operationrebirth/">@Operationrebirth</a> accidentally deleted the studio. Later,
Buriasa conquered The Great Battery Army and turned it into the new Buriasa.

        <h2>History</h2>

On October 19, 2024, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Operationrebirth/">@Operationrebirth</a> (co-owner of the [Classified] Union) asked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mastergamerx-details/">@mastergamerx-details</a> (owner of the [Classified] Union)  
if he could make "republics" or "branches" of the [Classified] Union. @mastergamerx-details agreed.
There was already a branch called "" (formerly Kingdom of Welstarr) and @Thegiriman2 created 3 more republics:
"Ezaria", "Buriasa", and "Werelesar". Then on November 1, 2024, the   
[Classified] Union was overtaken by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Operationrebirth/">@Operationrebirth</a> and given to The Popcorn Uprising.
Then, the "Imperial Rebels of [Classified] (IROC)" was created by @Thegiriman2. Little information is known of this entity.
On March 13, 2025, the Burisan Empire was created.
