<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a> is the second largest Scratch army, below the Republic of Scratch. It is owned by Sable Keystone
 
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a> originated as a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">[Classified] Union</a> Republic created by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Thegiriman2/">@Thegiriman2</a> 
on October 19, 2024. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a> gained independence from the [Classified] Union on 11/1/2024. 
In June 2025, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a> grew an upwards of 100 followers a day before <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Thegiriman2/">@Thegiriman2</a> accidentally deleted the studio. Later,
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a> conquered <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">The Great Battery Army</a> and turned it into the new <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50684702/comments">Buriasa</a>.

<h2>History</h2>

On October 19, 2024, @Thegiriman2 (co-owner of the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/35334321/comments">[Classified] Union</a>) asked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mastergamerx-details/">@mastergamerx-details</a> (owner of the [Classified] Union)  
if he could make "republics" or "branches" of the [Classified] Union. @mastergamerx-details agreed.
There was already a branch called "Welstarr" (formerly Kingdom of Welstarr) and @Thegiriman2 created 2 more republics:
"Ezaria" and "Buriasa". Then on November 1, 2024 (known as "The Triple One" in modern [Classified]) the   
[Classified] Union was overtaken by @Thegiriman2 and given to The Popcorn Uprising.
Then, the "Imperial Rebels of [Classified] (IROC)" was created by @Thegiriman2. Little information is known of this entity.
On March 13, 2025, the Burisan Empire was created.
